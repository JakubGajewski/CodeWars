CodeWars.com - great website with a lot of challanges for programmers!

I've solved couple of them, just for training - and my code is here. Every package is different KYU, and every class is different KATA.

KYU tells us how difficult is the challange (8 are the easiest), and every KATA is single challange - just like in KARATE.
